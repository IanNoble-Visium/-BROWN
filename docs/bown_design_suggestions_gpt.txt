According to a document from **Dec 17, 2025** (your “Campus Safety Initiative” draft), the core vision is to **fuse real-time video + sensor + operational data into a unified situational awareness layer**, with **explainable, auditable outputs** and **policy/role-based governance** to preserve campus trust. 

Below is a concrete **design + architecture package** for the **Brown University Campus Security Monitoring Platform** (demo / proof-of-concept) that aligns with that vision, the TruContext-style integration approach, and the operational gaps highlighted by recent reporting.

---

## 1) Web research findings to drive requirements

### What happened and what broke down (the “why now”)

I did not find a widely reported **December 2024** Brown “shooting” incident in official/major coverage; the major campus incident that dominates credible reporting is **Dec 13, 2025**. ([Reuters][1])

Key operational gaps reported:

* **Limited interior camera coverage + no clear suspect footage** inside the building where the shooting occurred. Reuters explicitly reports that officials said there were **limited cameras inside** the engineering/physics building and **none recorded clear footage** of the gunman. ([Reuters][1])
* The investigation and manhunt **leaned heavily on off-campus / residential security footage** due to a **lack of surveillance cameras in/around the classroom building and surrounding area**. ([Reuters][2])
* **Crisis communications churn**: Brown-affiliated reporting shows an alert claiming a suspect was in custody that was later **retracted**, plus other evolving updates. ([The Brown Daily Herald][3])
* Brown leadership referenced using the **Rave alert system** and coordination with city/state/federal law enforcement, as well as ongoing perimeter/crime-scene access constraints. ([Office of the President][4])

Your internal “Reimagining Campus Security” brief also frames the same class of problems as: camera counts don’t equal safety, blind spots exist, and legacy VMS is passive (record/review) rather than proactive (detect/alert/fuse). 

### Lessons learned from other universities (useful for demo storytelling)

To ground this beyond Brown:

* **UNC-Chapel Hill** commissioned an independent after-action review (CNA). Their exec summary highlights the role of **fast multi-channel alerting** (sirens + text/email) and emphasizes institutional learning across multiple response themes. ([Emergency Management and Planning][5])
* **Michigan State**’s post-incident path included investing in a **Security Operations Center** and a **unified video/security platform** with analytics (tracking movement, barrier breaches, crowd counting, etc.), alongside explicit **privacy concern** discussions. ([Bridge Michigan][6])

These two sources are great to cite in a Brown demo:
**“We’re not just showing cameras—we’re showing modern incident response operations + governance.”**

---

## 2) What an “effective camera + fused security system” could have done differently

Based on the gaps above, and aligning with your ELI + TruContext positioning:

1. **Eliminate blind spots with coverage intelligence**

* Maintain a **camera coverage heatmap** per building/floor and flag “high-risk rooms” with weak coverage (e.g., older interiors).
* Add a **camera health** layer (online/offline, FPS drops, blocked lens, low-light quality).

2. **Turn passive video into proactive detection**

* Use smart-camera events (weapon/person-down/fight/anomalous crowd) to generate **actionable alerts** rather than relying on manual review—exactly the shift your internal brief describes. 

3. **Fuse identities and locations (without pretending keycards are GPS)**

* Use Wi‑Fi device location + door events + camera detections + face match events + “phone signature” to build a **confidence-scored track** of a person-of-interest.
* Keep keycard/fob as **discrete events (“someone badged at Door X at Time T”)**, not continuous tracking.

4. **Improve comms discipline through workflow**

* Build “incident command” controls: **draft → approve → broadcast** for alerts, with a single source of truth feeding Rave / SMS / email / desktop popups. (This is a direct antidote to “conflicting updates” dynamics.) ([The Brown Daily Herald][3])

5. **Make investigations faster with graph + timeline**

* Your internal paper calls out topology graphs linking cameras/objects/alerts and incident management workflows. 
* TruContext marketing emphasizes ingesting disparate raw data and deriving context/relationships. ([Carahsoft][7])

That’s exactly the “wow” factor for a live demo: **click an alert → see the track → see linked evidence (door swipe + Wi‑Fi + camera) → see a timeline reconstruction**.

---

## 3) System architecture diagram

Here’s an architecture that is **demo-friendly now** (mock data + scenario playback) and **production-extensible later** (Neo4j, Cloudinary, Google AI, etc.).

Why this matches TruContext/ELI patterns:

* **“Ingest ANY data raw/native”** is a TruContext theme (cyber context originally, now physical security context). ([Carahsoft][7])
* Your internal ELI description emphasizes **ingestion/normalization, dashboards, topology graphs, incident workflows**, and **ethical governance**. 

---

## 4) Database schema design (PostgreSQL)

Design goal: support **real-time dashboards**, **fast time-range queries**, and **explainable correlation**.

### Core entities (campus model)

* `site(id, name)`
* `building(id, site_id, name)`
* `floor(id, building_id, name, level_number)`
* `floorplan(id, floor_id, image_url, scale_px_per_meter, origin_x, origin_y, created_at)`
* `zone(id, floor_id, name, polygon_geojson, type)`
  *type: classroom/hallway/stairwell/entry/perimeter/etc.*
* `camera(id, floor_id, name, rtsp_url, onvif_info, status, x, y, fov_deg)`
* `door(id, floor_id, name, x, y)`
* `access_reader(id, door_id, vendor, external_id)`
* `sensor(id, floor_id, type, external_id, x, y)`
  *type: motion/glassbreak/etc.*
* `wifi_ap(id, floor_id, name, bssid, x, y)`

### Identity + device model (privacy-aware)

* `person(id, display_name, role, is_watchlist, metadata_jsonb)` *(optional for demo; can keep anonymized)*
* `device(id, type, hashed_identifier, last_seen_at, metadata_jsonb)`
  *type: wifi / ble / phone_signature*
* `face_profile(id, person_id, embedding_ref, created_at)` *(store embedding in secure store; keep reference in DB)*

### Canonical event store (the backbone)

* `event(id, ts, source_type, source_id, event_type, severity, floor_id, x, y, payload_jsonb)`

  * `source_type`: camera / access / wifi / motion / face / phone
  * `event_type`: person_detected / weapon_detected / door_access / wifi_loc_update / motion_trigger / face_match / device_fingerprint / …
  * Indexes:

    * `(ts DESC)`
    * `(floor_id, ts DESC)`
    * `(event_type, ts DESC)`
    * GIN index on `payload_jsonb` for demo search

### Tracks (your “Pokémon map” people blobs + trails)

* `track(id, created_at, last_seen_at, classification, risk_score, display_label)`
* `track_observation(id, track_id, ts, floor_id, x, y, confidence, evidence_event_id)`
* `track_link(id, track_id, link_type, linked_id, confidence, rationale_jsonb)`

  * link_type: person/device/face_profile

This structure supports:

* **Current positions**: latest observation per track
* **History trail**: query `track_observation` for last 30 minutes (default) or longer (configurable)

### Alerts + incidents (ops workflow)

* `alert_rule(id, name, enabled, conditions_jsonb, severity, throttling_jsonb)`
* `alert(id, ts_opened, ts_updated, status, severity, title, description, floor_id, x, y, created_by)`
* `alert_event(alert_id, event_id)` *(many-to-many evidence binding)*
* `incident(id, ts_opened, status, commander_user_id, summary, tags)`
* `incident_item(id, incident_id, type, ref_id, notes)`
  *type: alert/event/track/camera/door*
* `audit_log(id, ts, user_id, action, entity_type, entity_id, details_jsonb)`

Your internal material repeatedly emphasizes **audit logs / role-based access / governance** as a must-have for campuses. 

---

## 5) Component/page structure (web app)

### Public / demo-facing

1. **Landing / Demo Hub** (`/`)

* Hero: b-roll, “What happened / what’s changed” narrative
* Buttons: “Live Demo”, “Scenario Playback”, “Docs”, “Deck”
* Download/view: presentations, product sheets, videos

2. **Login** (`/login`)

* Demo credentials: `admin/admin` (as requested)

### Authenticated dashboards

3. **Real-Time Location Tracking** (`/ops/tracking`) **(Priority)**

* Left: Building/Floor selector + zone filters
* Center: 2D floor plan (sprite-based “top-down map”)
* Right: “Who’s here” roster (tracks) + confidence + last seen
* Bottom: timeline scrubber (live ↔ replay), trail toggle (default 30 min)

4. **Camera Monitoring** (`/ops/cameras`)

* Grid view (virtualized for scale)
* Single camera view with overlays: active alerts, detections, zones
* Camera health panel: offline/low FPS/obstruction

5. **Alerts & Activity** (`/ops/alerts`)

* Unified feed from all systems
* Correlation clusters: “probable same actor/device”
* One-click: create incident from alert cluster

6. **Incident Workspace** (`/ops/incidents/:id`)

* Evidence board: linked events, tracks, camera clips, access swipes
* Collaboration notes + audit log view
* Auto-generated timeline (“story of the incident”)

7. **Admin / Config** (`/admin`)

* Floorplan upload & calibration
* Camera/door/sensor placement
* Integration toggles (demo mode vs prod mode)
* RBAC roles

UI motif to copy from ELI/TruContext positioning:

* “Single pane of glass” + “graph relationships + drill-down workflows” (explicit in your internal ELI description).

## 6) API endpoint specifications (PoC-ready)

Base: `/api/v1`

### Auth

* `POST /auth/login` → `{username, password}` → `{token, user}`
* `GET /auth/me`
* `POST /auth/logout`

### WebSocket (near real-time updates)

* `WS /ws`

  * topics: `events`, `alerts`, `tracks`, `camera_health`, `incidents`

---

## 7) Integration approach per data source

### A) IREX smart cameras (same as Peru ELI)

**Goal:** ingest both **video** and **analytics events**.

* **Video**: RTSP/ONVIF into a media service that converts to browser-friendly streams (HLS/WebRTC).
* **Events**: webhook or message-bus ingestion (JSON) → normalized canonical `event` records.

Your internal brief explicitly calls for **standards-based connectors (RTSP, ONVIF, webhook APIs)**. 

### B) Access control (door key fobs / RFID)

* Pull from vendor API or subscribe to event stream.
* Normalize to `event_type = door_access` with `door_id`, `card_id_hash`, `result`, `direction`, etc.
* Fusion logic: door event provides a **high-confidence discrete location** at a timestamp.

### C) Motion sensors

* MQTT/HTTP ingestion (simple).
* Used for:

  * “Pop nearby cameras”
  * “Zone occupancy spike”
  * Correlation with Wi‑Fi + video detections

### D) Wi‑Fi location (Cisco Catalyst Center + Cisco Spaces/CMX)

What Cisco tooling supports (relevant to your floor-plan dashboard):

* Catalyst Center / DNA Center supports **creating/importing floor maps** and placing wireless components for visualization. ([Cisco][8])
* Cisco Spaces supports **location hierarchies and maps** that unify hierarchies and digital maps. ([Cisco][9])
* Cisco Spaces Detect & Locate is positioned for **current & historical device location** and “device tracker” capabilities. ([Cisco Spaces][10])
* Device “staleness” matters: Detect & Locate uses an eviction time (example: 10 minutes), so your UI should gray-out stale tracks. ([Cisco][11])

Implementation in your app:

* A `wifi-ingestor` polls or subscribes to Spaces/CMX location events.
* Normalize to `event_type = wifi_loc_update` with `(x,y,floor_id, device_hash, rssi, confidence)`.
* Fusion engine merges Wi‑Fi device with known device registry (optional) or leaves anonymous.

**Important constraint (your note is correct):** you cannot “track” a traditional keycard like a Wi‑Fi tag—only door events. The system must represent that honestly in UI/logic.

### E) Facial recognition (camera-based identification)

For demo:

* Use a mock “face_match” event generator with confidence scores and a watchlist.

For production:

* Store minimal biometric artifacts:

  * embeddings in secure store (or encrypted column),
  * strict RBAC for “reveal identity,”
  * immutable audit logs for access/export.

This matches your internal governance posture: **privacy-by-design, access controls, audit trails, bias mitigation**. 

### F) Phone signatures (device fingerprinting)

For demo:

* Treat this as a second device signal that can sometimes link to Wi‑Fi observations.

For production:

* Be conservative: modern OS randomization and privacy policies make persistent tracking unreliable and sensitive; build it as **opt-in / policy-controlled** and emphasize “confidence-scored correlation,” not certainty.

---

## 8) UI/UX mockup recommendations (what will “wow” in a live demo)

### The “Pokémon-style” tracking map

Use a 2D renderer designed for sprites + smooth motion:

* **PixiJS** or **Konva** (fast canvas/WebGL rendering)
* Tweening movement between last two points for “alive” feel
* Trail rendering:

  * polyline for 30 minutes default
  * density-based fading
  * “jump floors” shown as elevator/stair node transitions

### Explainability panel (differentiator)

Every track shows:

* **Confidence meter** (0–100)
* Evidence list:

  * “Wi‑Fi device seen near AP-12”
  * “Door swipe at Door-3”
  * “Person detected on Camera-17”
  * “Face match 0.82 (policy restricted)”
* This is how you align with the TruContext “verifiable intelligence / audit trails” messaging. ([EIN Presswire][12])

### “Scenario Replay” mode (demo gold)

* Time slider: T‑30 min → T+10 min
* One-click “inject event”: door forced-open, weapon detected, motion spike
* Auto-generated “incident timeline” board

Your Brown deck already frames a **90-day roadmap** and emphasizes real-time detection, dispatch integration, privacy-first design, etc. 

---

## 9) Implementation roadmap (demo-first, extensible)

### Phase 0 — Demo foundation (Week 1–2)

* Frontend shell: Landing + login + nav
* Postgres schema + seed data
* WebSocket live updates
* Scenario player (JSON timeline → events)

### Phase 1 — Camera dashboard MVP (Week 3–4)

* Camera inventory, grid view, single view
* Mock streams (or limited real feeds)
* Camera health status widget

### Phase 2 — Real-time tracking MVP (Week 5–6)

* Floorplans upload + calibration
* Sprite-based tracks + smoothing
* History trail toggle (30 min default; configurable)

### Phase 3 — Correlation + alerts (Week 7–8)

* Canonical events → fusion engine → tracks
* Alert rules + alert feed + acknowledge/close
* Create incident from alert cluster

### Phase 4 — “TruContext-style” investigation UX (Week 9–10)

* Incident workspace + evidence board
* Relationship graph (optional in demo, huge impact visually)

### Phase 5 — Demo polish (Week 11–12)

* Guided “demo script” buttons
* Performance hardening + UI animations
* Exportable after-action summary (PDF) for showmanship

This lines up with the 90-day concept already in your Brown proposal slides. 

---

## 10) Notes on the Peru ELI GitHub + TruContext site context

* I attempted to retrieve `IanNoble-Visium/ELI` via web search, but it does **not appear publicly indexed/accessible** in my browsing tool results (likely private), so I can’t reliably quote specific components from that repo.
* The Visium “platform” pages also appeared heavily script-rendered in my tool view, so I used alternate first-order sources describing TruContext capabilities (Carahsoft partner post; Visium press release). ([Carahsoft][7])

If you can share either:

* a ZIP export of the repo, or
* screenshots of the Peru dashboard nav/pages/components,
  …I can map **exact component reuse** (layout, state mgmt, WebSocket/event patterns, camera grid implementation) directly into this Brown PoC plan.

---

If you want, I can also produce a **one-page “demo storyboard”** (exact clicks/steps during the Brown presentation) so the platform tells a crisp story: *“gap → detection → tracking → correlation → response → audit.”*
